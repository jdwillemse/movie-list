Movie library
===========================================

This app listens for file changes in a dropbox folder where movie torrent files are added. The newly added file name is processed and the movie info is fetched from OMDBapi. This info is then saved to Firebase. A list of movies is then displayed along with whether they have been watched or not.

Here is a [demo](https://movie-lib.herokuapp.com/).

### Purpose
This project is not done or bug free and probably wont ever be. This serves as a to-do list app for me. In this build I was looking for a production-ready universal React starter with little setup. I tested [this appraoch](https://medium.com/@benlu/ssr-with-create-react-app-v2-1b8b520681d9), but found too many compromises so the search continues.
